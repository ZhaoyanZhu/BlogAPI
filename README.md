# BlogAPI
In this project, I created a blog API that can handle these requests:

  1.GET http://localhost:4000/posts
    Get all blog posts

  2.GET http://localhost:4000/posts/:id
    Get a specific post by id

  3.POST http://localhost:4000/posts
    Create a new blog

  4.PATCH http://localhost:4000/posts/:id
    Edit an existing post

  5.DELETE http://localhost:4000/posts/:id
    Delete a specific post by id

In this porject, there is also a server to test this API.
Use npm install to get all dependencies, and open two terminals. One run "node index.js", the other one run "node server.js".
Go to http://localhost:3000
